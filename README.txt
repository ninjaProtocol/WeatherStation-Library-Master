README - May 2015

This is the code required for our Senior Year Engineering project for B.Tech

All this code will eventually be put up on GitHub, and as such is open source.
Please do give credit if you build on our work.

weatherFinal.ino - main sketch, not an "example" but we had to put it there to show 
up in the examples menu

WeatherStation.h - header file for library, contains base class and declarations
WeatherStation.cpp - source file, contains definitions and methods

This project and library depends on other libraries, listed in the above files.

You must put those libraries with the required modifications in your 
Documents\Arduino\libraries folder for this to work. This library must also be in
the same folder. 

Modifications detailed in lib_modifications.txt.

Best regards,
